/*

  - By default, linkState() will try to derive the appropriate value from an event automatically.
  - For example, an <input> element will set the given state property to event.target.value
  - or event.target.checked depending on the input type.
  - For custom event handlers, passing scalar values to the handler generated by linkState()
  - will simply use the scalar value. Most of the time, this behavior is desirable.

  - There are cases where this is undesirable,
  - however - custom events and grouped radio buttons are two such examples.
  - In these cases, a third argument can be passed to linkState()
  - to specify the dot-notated key path within the event where a value can be found.

  - The following illustrates a manually created event handler
  - that persists a value from within an Event object into state.
  - It is functionally equivalent to the linkState() version,
  - though does not include the memoization optimization that makes linkState() valuable.
