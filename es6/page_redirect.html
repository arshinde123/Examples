/*
window.location.replace("http://www.abc.com

window.location.assign("http://www.abc.org");

--> assign() vs. replace()

The difference between assign() and replace() method is that
the location.replace() method deletes the current URL from the document history,
so it is unable to navigate back to the original document.
You can't use the browsers "Back" button in this case.
If you want to avoid this situation, you should use location.assign() method,
because it loads a new Document in the browser.

/*
location.reload()

The location.reload() method reloads the current document in the browser window.

Following is the syntax for the same.

window.location.reload("http://www.yahoo.com");

/*
  Redirection and Search Engine Optimization

  If you want to notify the search engines (SEO) about your URL forwarding,
  you should add the rel = "canonical" meta tag to your website head part
  because search engines don't analyze JavaScript to check the redirection.

  Following is the syntax for the same.

  <link rel = "canonical" href = "http://abc.com/" />
